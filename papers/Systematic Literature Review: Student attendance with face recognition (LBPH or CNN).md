**Algorithms Used and How They Were Used**:

- **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)**:
  - A traditional machine learning algorithm that analyzes local features in grayscale images.
  - Known for its simplicity, low computational cost, and effectiveness in controlled environments.
  - Often used in systems where computational resources are limited or where rapid implementation is required.

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**:
  - A deep learning algorithm capable of automatically learning hierarchical features from images.
  - Demonstrated higher accuracy and robustness, especially in varying lighting conditions and with diverse facial expressions.
  - Requires more computational power and a larger dataset for training but offers superior performance in complex environments.

**Limitations**:

- **LBPH**:
  - Performance can degrade under varying lighting conditions and with changes in facial expressions.
  - Less effective in large-scale deployments with diverse populations.

- **CNN**:
  - Requires substantial computational resources and a significant amount of training data.
  - Implementation can be more complex and time-consuming compared to traditional methods.

**Conclusion**:

The review concludes that while both LBPH and CNN have their merits, CNN-based systems generally offer higher accuracy and better adaptability to real-world conditions. However, the choice between LBPH and CNN should be guided by the specific requirements and constraints of the educational institution, such as available computational resources, desired accuracy, and environmental conditions.
